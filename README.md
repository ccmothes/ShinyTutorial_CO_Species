This repo hosts the code I've written for an additional ~15 minute tutorial in relation to the Geospatial Centroid's R Spatial training course. 

I've created an online tutorial which can be viewed [here](https://rpubs.com/ccmothes/755707).

The Shiny app produced in this tutorial can be viewed [here](https://ccmothes.shinyapps.io/ColoradoSpecies/).
